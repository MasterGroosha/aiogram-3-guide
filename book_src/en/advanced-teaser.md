# Advanced Level

!!! warning "Currently only in Russian"
    The course listed below is currently only in Russian and there are no plans to translate it at this time.

Is BotAPI already second nature to you? Do you start your day by reading the documentation? 
Are you bored with simple bots but hesitant to tackle complex ones?

I present to you a new course, 
"[Telegram Bots in Python: Advanced Level](https://stepik.org/a/153850?utm_source=aiogram3guide&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=promo_page)," 
where I am one of the authors. 
Currently, the course is in **early access**, 
with about 70% of the material written, but it will soon be supplemented with new modules. 
You can already gain knowledge that will be useful not only for writing bots but also for other Python projects.

Here are just a few examples:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-widgets:{ .lg .middle } __aiogram-dialog__

    ---

    Create beautiful and convenient interfaces within the messenger window using 
    [aiogram-dialog](https://github.com/Tishka17/aiogram_dialog).

  - :simple-pytest:{ .lg .middle } __Testing__

      ---

      Verify the correctness of your code's logic without tedious manual testing and 
      "catching bugs in production."

-   :simple-docker:{ .lg .middle } __Docker__

    ---

    Build Docker containers for quick and convenient deployment and sharing 
    with other users. Automate the build in GitHub and GitLab. Work with Docker Compose.

-   :material-translate-variant:{ .lg .middle } __Localization__ 

    ---

    Teach your bots to communicate with users in different languages. 
    In this, [Babel](https://github.com/python-babel/babel) and 
    [Project Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/) will help you.

-   :simple-natsdotio:{ .lg .middle } __Queues__ *

    ---

    Use queues and message brokers (RabbitMQ, NATS),
    to offload various tasks into separate microservices for 
    increased reliability and delivery guarantees.

-   :material-database:{ .lg .middle } __Working with DBMS__ *

    ---

    Use modern databases and tools to work with them 
    for fast and efficient storage of user information and
    their content.
