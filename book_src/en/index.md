# **Welcome!**

What you see before you is what I, [Groosha](https://mastergroosha.github.io/), call a book on creating Telegram bots in Python
using the [aiogram](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram) framework. This \[book\] can be seen as a study material, 
referring to individual chapters as needed, but for the first reading, I recommend doing it in the order that the chapters
are listed to the left of this text.

This is the third version of the guide, with the [first](https://mastergroosha.github.io/telegram-tutorial/) written in 2015-2017 
for the [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) library, and 
the [second](https://mastergroosha.github.io/aiogram-2-guide/) appearing in 2019 for aiogram 2.x. 
In this updated version of the book, we will be using version 3 of aiogram, which had its full release on September 1, 2023.

**Who is this book for?**

It is assumed that you are familiar with programming in general and with the Python language in particular, 
know what "venv" and "pip" are, and are capable of understanding and fixing "childish" errors like _SyntaxError_ and _IndentationError_. 
Find a couple of Python courses on the internet, go through them, and only then start writing bots, it will save you time and nerves.

In all chapters, we will be using something from the GNU/Linux family as the operating system, for instance, [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), 
Python 3.11 (in a Virtual Environment), and the [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) development environment, 
although [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is also a fine choice. Meanwhile, Windows users are not left out: 
everything related to the code will work smoothly for you too, and for specific things like systemd, you can use Ubuntu in [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org).

The text of the book and the source code in the [relevant repository](https://github.com/MasterGroosha/aiogram-3-guide) 
are completely free, published under the MIT license, and available to anyone for download, modification, and use for any purpose.

**Donations**  
I spent a lot of time and effort writing and updating the book. If you are from Russia and want to thank the author financially,
